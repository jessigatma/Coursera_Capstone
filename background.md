<h1> Need for collective public spaces in marginalized areas of the metropolitan area of ​​Guadalajara, Mexico </h1>

(Introduction)

<h2> Problem Definition </h2>

Locate the marginalized areas of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area where an intervention for the construction of collective public spaces (parks) is urgent, taking into account the population density of each region.

This project is aimed at the <b>public sector</b> as it seeks to help improve the quality of life of people in marginalized areas and improve the social fabric.

In 15 years, violence in Mexico has been growing and the metropolitan area of ​​Guadalajara, which is the second largest city in Mexico, is the third state with high levels of insecurity. Only in 2019 has there been a 50% growth in criminal acts.

The areas with the highest number of homicides are found in the metropolitan area of ​​Guadalajara, urban locations characterized by their high degree of marginalization.

The lack of planning of the city of Guadalajara and its accelerated growth, has not allowed to create favorable environments for the communities where they can have recreational or sports activities. Marginalized groups have to live in permanent confinement within their home, which is becoming smaller and smaller (a family lives on average in 40 square meters) and avoids the construction of healthy social networks.

The World Health Organization(WHO) recommends a collective public space of 11 square meters per inhabitant, however, in Guadalajara it has only reached 4.5 square meters. Timely intervention for the creation of collective public spaces in marginalized areas would not only help to improve the quality of life of the marginalized population, but could also become an effective strategy to combat crime by having better community development.
